;;; Commentary:

;; This is a set of interactive functions for text compression and
;; decompression using the popular dictionary-based Lempel-Ziv-Welch
;; algorithm.

;; All functions run inside of Emacs and do not depend on external
;; tools, such as zip or gzip. The algorithm itself is implemented in C
;; for performance reasons, and used in Emacs as an external module.

;; This requires at least Emacs 25, and compiling the module.
;; Compiling the module is done using clang by default, but the Makefile
;; can be easily modified if another compiler is desired (such as gcc).

;; For use of this package, examine all user-facing interactive functions
;; with the prefix `lzw-'.
