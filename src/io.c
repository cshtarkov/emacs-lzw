    Commentary:

    This module handles reading and writing the codeword array
    to files in an efficient manner. This could be handled by
    Emacs itself, but having it implemented in C:

    1) Allows for the program to be used standalone outside of Emacs.
    2) Allows for better control of the IO stream.

    A drawback is that it doesn't work with TRAMP.
    You can save the file to a temporary location on the
    local filesystem, and then copy it over using TRAMP.
